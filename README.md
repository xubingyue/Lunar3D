### Contributing
At the moment, you should be able to just pull the code, and import as an existing project. When adding more code, please try
to keep the style the same as the code everywhere else. Just examine the code around your patch before you begin to program.

To compile you will need to use a 32-bit MinGW/GCC on Windows, or a -m32 flag on other platforms.
